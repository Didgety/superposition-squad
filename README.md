The following files are used to solve the Track 2: Quantum Optimization for Impact - Knapsack problem. 

`minimization_experiments.ipynb` 
- This file sets up the simulation of the quantum circuits & contains various experiments to determine the optimal value that minimizes the Hamiltonian cost function to solve the Knapsack optimization problem.
- Here, we have tried experiments with different minimization algorithms & penalty factors.

`q3hack.ipynb`
- This file is our final work on simulators & real IBM Hardware.
